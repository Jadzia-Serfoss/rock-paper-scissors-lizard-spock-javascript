# rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-javascript
Beginner level rock paper scissors (+lizard and Spock) game using JavaScript.
This version of the game is inspired by the TV show The Big Bang Theory. I did not invent the concept. 

According to Sheldon Cooper, the rules go as follows: 

"Scissors cuts paper, 
paper covers rock, 
rock crushes lizard, 
lizard poisons Spock, 
Spock smashes scissors, 
scissors decapitates lizard, 
lizard eats paper, 
paper disproves Spock, 
Spock vaporizes rock,
and (as it always has) rock crushes scissors."
